Two solution has been shown below:
1. Brute Force solution
2. DP solution

                              BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION

//subsequences

    //No more elements left to include in the subsequence

    //cannot include it

        return lis_brute(a,current+1,n,previous);
    }
 
    //else once include and once don't include the current element
    //and select the longest increasing subsequences out of these
    return max(1+lis_brute(a,current+1,n,a[current]),lis_brute(a,current+1,n,previous));

    //fourth argument to keep track of value of previous element in the selected subsequence so far
    //this is initialized to INT_MIN because initially there is no selected subsequence,
    //so, no previous element

            //means a[i] can be appended after b[j]
            //Since, we are interested in finding the longest of such subsequences, we will consider

    }
 
    //now, we have calculated all the values of b[i] for 0<=i<n
    //The length of the longest increasing subsequence of the given array is the maximum of all
